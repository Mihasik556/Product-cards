# Product Cards with CSS Grid

A simple project showcasing a set of product cards built using **HTML** and **CSS Grid**.  
Each card includes a title, description, price, and call-to-action button.  
The main focus of this project is practicing CSS Grid and creating a clean, responsive layout.
Also I want to say that in this project I used SVGs. Tbh, they own 90% of my html code :)
